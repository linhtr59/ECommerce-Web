                <p>It all began with a dream of a small place where the food has to be simple, clever, tasty and fun.
                    </br>
                    A place where we could enjoy lighthearted conversation while tasting good wines and good foods from
                    around the world without being rushed for other guests to sit down. So after a decade of discussions
                    and ideas it is time for Twenty Seats to become a reality. </br>
                    </br>
                    As the name suggests Twenty Seats will welcome around twenty customers only per night to enjoy a 10
                    courses tasting menu with influence from around the world. </br>
                    </br>
                    Our dining area is divided into two small rooms. </br>
                    In our main room, there is space for 14 guests, We also offer a very special intimate private area
                    with a single table where 5 to 6 guests can relax and enjoy our dining experience. </br>
                    Our kitchen is run by 3 chefs, Todd Stuart head chef and owner ( previously chef/owner of Petite
                    Mort) Nam from Vietnam and Viviane from Italy. </br>
                    </br>
                    Service is generally French, led by Remy Legodec the restaurant Manager and Adrien Leclerc his
                    Assistant </br></p>
