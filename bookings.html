                <li>Twenty Seats is not suitable for large groups or functions </li>
                <li>By offering a single tasting menu of 10 courses, Twenty Seats is unfortunately not recommended for

                </li>
                <li>Seats are very limited and we do not accept tables of 1 or 3 guests. </li>
                <li>Bookings can be made online only or requested by email if dates are open (we do not take bookings

            <p><strong>Allergies and dietary</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Because we operate in a very small place, severe allergies may not be able to be catered for. Any
                    wish
                    of changes or alterations to the menu due to <strong>dietary requirements</strong> must have been
                    confirmed by us at least 48 hours before your booking. Unfortunately, we will not be able to make
                    any
                    changes without notice.</li>
                <li>We will do our best to cater for everyone however with this current menu we are not able to cater
                    for:
                    <strong>Vegan, Dairy free Vegetarian , FODMAP Diet or any Anaphylactic requirements.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>We can do reduced dairy but not 100% dairy free.</li>
                <li>Please contact us to discuss dietaries if you are unsure before making your booking.</li>

                    booking, a cancellation fee ($135 per person) will be taken.</li>
                <li>This is not our priority to charge a cancellation fee, this time frame will allow us to rebook the

                    apply.
